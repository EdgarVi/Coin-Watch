# Coin Watch
## Cryptocurrency price screener
Developed by Edgar Villasenor

Visualizer of cryptocurrency prices and trends. Data is collected in real time.

Inspired by [Coinbase Pro (originally known as GDAX)](https://pro.coinbase.com/), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and [Coinranking](https://coinranking.com/).

For all intensive purposes, Coin Watch is essentially a clone of Coinranking. At the moment, I do not intend to profit from this project. This is being developed as a hands on way to learn full stack web development and as a project to showcase for future employers.

## API
API is provided by Coinranking [here](https://docs.coinranking.com/)

## Tech Stack
Currently, the project is frontend only and has been intialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In future iterations I plan on adding a backend to manage user profiles.


## Future Plans
On future iterations of this app, I plan on adding user profiles. Users may be able to create a watchlist of crytpocurrencies they are interested in and "paper trade" cryptocurrencies to see how they would perform against the market.
